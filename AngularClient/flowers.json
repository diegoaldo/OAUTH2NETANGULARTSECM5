    "Description": "Agrimony is the remedy for people who keep their troubles hidden under a mask of pleasure and happiness. The sad clown masking inner hurt by being the life and soul of the party is an Agrimony archetype. Friends are often the last to know that anything is wrong in the Agrimony person\u0027s life.\nSometimes Agrimony people turn to drink or drugs to help them stay \u0027happy\u0027. They tend not to like being alone: the mask slips when there is no company. They seek out friends, parties and bright lights. Only at night when they are alone with their thoughts will the mental torture they have repressed come back to haunt them.\nAgrimony helps us come to terms with the darker side of our lives and personalities, so that we can become more rounded human beings. We won\u0027t lose our sense of humor or our ability to get through the day, but will find that laughing at our troubles dispels them rather than hides them. As a mood remedy, Agrimony helps anyone who is trying not to face a trouble and using jokes and false smiles to avoid a painful reality.\n",

At one end of the spectrum the Aspen fear may be no more than a sense of foreboding, an uneasy anxiety that something unpleasant or frightening is going to happen. At the other it can be a real terror, with physical symptoms such as the hair standing on end.\nSometimes people think of Aspen as a night-time fear, related to dreams and night terrors. Aspen would certainly be the right remedy if you were lying awake in the dark scared of something but not knowing what it was. But in fact Dr Bach said that fear of the dark is a Mimulus fear, since the cause (the dark) can be named. And nameless Aspen fears are just as likely to occur in full sunlight as on a dark night.\n",

Fears of going mad and of acting irrationally are Cherry Plum states.\nCherry Plum is also the remedy for a loss of control that has already taken place, because of the frantic fear and dread associated with such situations.

Genuine Elm types are people who are successful and carrying out work they believe in, but at times the burden brings them down and they feel will not be able to cope.\nThe remedy helps to dispel these feelings so that we can resume our lives without thought of failure.\nThe Elm state can be usefully contrasted with that of Larch. People in the former take up challenges willingly and only occasionally doubt their abilities; it\u0027s the scale of a task, rather than the difficulty of doing something well, that causes the crisis. Larch people are convinced they are going to fail right from the start, and so tend not to try in the first place.\n",

Often the feeling lifts by itself, but the remedy can be used to lift it sooner so that we are able to make things go right instead of just hoping they will.\nGentian is often confused with Gorse, which is also a remedy for feeling down when things go wrong. The difference is largely one of degree. People in a Gorse state have decided to give up. They refuse to be encouraged, and even if they seek a solution they will do so grudgingly, assuring everyone that there is no use trying. People in a Gentian state are less pessimistic and more prepared to try again.\n",

If ill, they may think themselves incurable, and that nothing can be done.\nNevertheless, Dr Bach classified Gorse as a remedy for uncertainty, and not as a remedy for despairalongside Sweet Chestnut. This demonstrates that the main problem with Gorse people is a loss of faith: if we can be persuaded to see things in a different light there is usually a way forward. This is what the Gorse remedy helps to achieve.\n",

Thus the thing Heather people fear - loneliness - is brought about because of their behaviour.\nThe remedy helps us see our own concerns in the context of other people\u0027s. Having suffered ourselves from the need to talk, we become good listeners. As a result people seek us out for our compassion rather than avoiding us because of our self-centredness.\n",

    "Description": "Willow is for people who feel resentful and bitter about the way their lives have gone.\nIn a Willow state we begrudge others their success and happiness, and are reluctant to admit when our own lives go well. We prefer to grumble, and are prone to resentment and self-pity.\nThe remedy encourages the rebirth of optimism and faith. It helps us feel more generous towards others and more aware that negative thinking can attract the very ill-fortune of which we complain.\n",
